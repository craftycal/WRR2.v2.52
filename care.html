              <h2>Care Guide</h2>
              <h3>Diet</h3>
              <p>
                Rabbits need unlimited access to grass and/or grass hay. They are
                fibrevores, which means first and foremost, they need fiber. Therefore
                the most essential part of any rabbit’s diet is grass and hay.
              </p>

              <h5>Water:</h5>
              <p>
                Rabbits need access to clean drinking water 24/7. Depending
                on your rabbit’s preference, this can be in a heavy bowl (they
                tend to tip over plastic bowls), a licker bottle, or both. You should
                clean out and change your bunny's water container regularly.
              </p>
              <img src="images/rabbit-models-46(1)-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="a grey and white Netherland dwarf rabbit and his companion, a brown agouti flemmish giant, sit surrounded by bunny food">

              <h5>Hay:</h5>
              <p>
                Hay provides long-strand fiber, which is essential for a rabbit’s
                gut as well as helping to keep their teeth in order. Rabbit’s teeth
                grow continuously throughout their life and they need to eat fibrous
                foods in order to keep their teeth worn down. Rabbits that
                don’t eat enough hay develop painful spurs on their teeth which, if
                left untreated, will make it painful for them to eat. They may even
                stop eating which, in a rabbit, is fatal.
              </p>
              <img src="images/rabbit-models-37-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
              <p>
                Rabbits will naturally graze all day long so they should always have
                access to fresh, good quality hay. You can purchase hay from local farm
                stores such as <a href="http://www.ruraltradingpost.co.nz/" target="_blank">Rural Trading Post</a> and <a href="http://www.sharpesfeedbarn.co.nz/" target="_blank">Sharpes.</a>
                You can also find a variety of hay at pet stores.
              </p>

              <h5>Grass:</h5>
              <p>
                The fibrous content of grass keeps a Rabbit’s gut mobile.
                The action of nibbling on grass is also good for their teeth.
              </p>

              <h5>Vegetables:</h5>
              <p>
                Rabbits love green vegetables and a good guide is about a cup of
                fresh vegetables per day. Leafy greens are best, including kale,
                broccoli (including broccoli) stalks and leaves, silverbeet and
                other beet leaves, celery, spinach and herbs such as parsley and
                coriander. Rabbits also love carrot tops, though the carrot itself
                should be fed in moderation as it has a high sugar content - too
                much is not good for your rabbit. Please be aware that any vegetables
                that are high in water content are not great for your rabbit. Iceberg
                lettuce in particular should be avoided. If you do feed your bunny
                lettuce, ensure it’s a small amount and that your rabbit has access
                to plenty of fibrous food such as hay.
              </p>
              <img src="images/rabbit-models-15(1)-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">

              <h5>Fruit:</h5>
              <p>
                Rabbits naturally have a very sweet tooth and fruit is a great
                way to give them a treat. About 1-2 tablespoons of fruit a day is
                recommended. Rabbits love bananas, apples, grapes, mango and
                pears. Dried fruits are also great treats, for example raisins, dried
                pineapple, dried apricots and dates, but be aware that a dried fruit
                is much smaller than the same fruit before it is dried, so it can
                be easy to feed too much by accident. Remove the pips from all fruit
                where possible.
              </p>

              <h5>Rabbit Pellets:</h5>
              <p>
                The general rule with rabbit food is that
                the plainer it is the better. Avoid muesli style food and opt
                for a plain, high fiber pellet. The best rabbit pellet brands
                available in NZ are <a href="http://www.oxbowanimalhealth.com/products/type/detail?object=1550" target="_blank">Oxbow</a>
                and <a href="http://www.animates.co.nz/small-pet/small-pet-food-treats/burgess-excel-rabbit-nuggets-2kg.html" target="_blank">Burgess Excel.</a>
                If you are buying from a farm store then the best brand is
                <a href="https://store.nzfarmsource.co.nz/catalog/nrm-rabbit-pellets-10kg/213265" target="_blank">NRM.</a>
              </p>

              <h5>Forage:</h5>
              <p>
                Several common garden plants are safe for rabbits to eat
                and they are generally good at knowing what they can and can’t eat.
                However, please only feed plants that you know are not poisonous
                to your rabbit and ensure the plants have not been sprayed with weedkillers
                or pesticides. As with any new food, add it in gradually to your
                rabbits diet and keep an eye out for any changes in your rabbit’s
                poo. If your rabbit has diarrhea contact a rabbit
                savvy vet immediately - any digestive problem in a rabbit should be considered an emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Branches are great for rabbits to chew on and again this is good
                for their teeth. Try willow, rose, or taupata as well as fruit branches
                such as apple, pear, or hawthorne. As a general rule, avoid branches
                from fuits with a single seed (plum, cherry, apricot, peach etc)
                as these are usually poisonous to rabbits. Flax is good for bunnies
                to chew on and will help keep them occupied.
              </p>

              <h5>Caecotrophs:</h5>
              <p>
                As part of their normal diet rabbits eat a particular kind of their
                own droppings called Caecotrophs. They need to do this as they cannot
                extract all the vital fiber and nutrients they need first time around.
                The bacteria from their first pass also provides them with protein
                and B vitamins. Unlike the normal dry droppings you often see, caecotrophs
                are shiny, sticky and smelly. Rabbits eat these directly from the
                anus so you shouldn’t see them often. To see them occasionally is
                normal but regular sightings may mean that your rabbit’s diet is
                either too rich or they are having problems eating, possibly
                due to obesity, large dewlaps, or dental problems. You should
                contact a rabbit savvy vet if you have any concerns.

              <h3>Housing</h3>
              <p>
                When it comes to housing your rabbit the general rule is the more
                space the better. Rabbits need lots of exercise!
              </p>
              <p>
                WRR has a minimum space
                requirement of 1m wide x
                1m high x 2m long – this
                should include a warm dry
                ‘bed’ space of at least 61cm
                x 61cm

                Most hutches available on

                be the only place for rabbits
                to live in.

                  They can easily be adapted by permanently attaching runs or pens,
                  and can be made more secure by adding a roof. If you have a
                  secure property then you could roof your pens with something as simple as bird
                  netting or chicken mesh. If you feel predators could be
                  an issue then you should use weldmesh.
                  Areas of your home and garden can also be made rabbit-proof so
                  your bunnies can live free range. Feel free to message us for suggestions
                  and advice!

                <p>
                  Rabbits are very tidy creatures and can be litter trained. You can
                  use a cat litter tray (I find this works best) or the corner litter trays
                  designed for rabbits. You can use many different things for litter
                  – the best type of litter is recycled newspaper litter. A good idea is
                  to line the tray with newspaper, put down the recycled newspaper
                  litter and then put straw over top.
                  <p>
                    Litter training is SUPER easy!
                    Every time they poop just
                    scoop it up and place it in the
                    litter tray until your bunny gets
                    the idea. If you find they aren’t
                    choosing to pee in their litter
                    tray then if you place a tissue in
                    their pee and then place it under
                    the straw in the litter tray
                    this will help them know where
                    to go.
                  </p>

                    If you are planning on having indoor, litter trained rabbits then
                    you need to “rabbit proof” your house. Rabbits love to chew cords
                    – whether they are plugged in or not! To save your bunny (and your wallet) getting
                    shocked, we recommend having
                    any cords tied up and well out of bunny's reach!

                  <p>
                    Rabbits are highly intelligent and are often misunderstood due to
                    their quiet nature. They need lots of stimulation to prevent them
                    from getting bored. These don’t need to be expensive toys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A great bunny toy is a simple cardboard box - just cut two door holes
                    and they will happily explore and enjoy “renovating” their box to their liking.
                    A cardboard tube/empty toilet roll or egg box
                    stuffed with hay and a few raisins makes a great toy, as do fabric
                    tunnels. They also love digging and jumping so fill a box with soil or
                    try giving them a sandpit.

                  <h3>Socialisation/Rabbit Bonding</h3>
                  <p>
                    Rabbits are very social animals
                    and thrive with the company of
                    their own kind. In the wild they
                    live in large colonies and this
                    social side of their nature is still
                    very evident in the domestic
                    rabbit. At WRR we don’t believe
                    any rabbit should live alone.
                    This is partly for their mental
                    health - they need interaction
                    and a friend for company, but
                    also for their physical wellbeing. Rabbits are very clean animals
                    and will groom each other. This is also a sign of affection between
                    rabbits.

                    Young rabbits housed together will often begin to fight when they
                    reach sexual maturity, around 3 - 6 months of age. If the fighting leads to biting or any skin
                    injury then they need to be separated until they are desexed.

                    WRR help to ‘bond’ rabbits. Bonding
                    involves introducing rabbits
                    on neutral territory where neither
                    rabbit has been before, for short
                    periods of time depending on how
                    they get along. For more information

                  <h3>The Rabbit Human Relationship</h3>
                  <p>
                    Rabbits are prey animals and, contrary to popular belief, most do
                    not like being picked up. This is because, to a rabbit, being picked up
                    off the ground is similar to being caught by a predator.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rabbits do, however, like receiving
                    attention with all four legs
                    on the ground. They love having
                    their heads and ears stroked
                    and many enjoy having their cheeks
                    rubbed.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You will often need to earn a rabbit’s trust before handling them. A good way
                    to let your rabbit know that you aren’t a threat is to just
                    spend time with it. Get down to their level and sit or lie down in
                    their pen; allow them to come to you in their own time. This may
                    take a while but it’s worth being patient. Rabbits love treats like
                    dried fruit so try hand feeding them one or two morsels when you
                    sit with them. They will soon start to associate you with treats and
                    before too long will run up to you and allow you to pat them.

                  <h3>Desexing</h3>
                  <p>
                    ALL rabbits should be desexed and vaccinated. Here are a few good
                    reasons why:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      There are too many unwanted rabbits in animal shelters all
                      over the New Zealand. Unfortunately a huge number of healthy
                      rabbits are euthanised each day because there are not enough
                      homes or spaces in shelters for them. Desexing your rabbit
                      means preventing more animals suffering this fate. <br/>(WRR never
                      euthanises rabbits unless they are too sick or injured to survive
                      and it is in their best interest. This decision is never taken lightly.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Rabbits breed... well, like rabbits. A female
                      rabbit can have up to 10 babies per litter and can get pregnant
                      again as soon as she has given birth. That's up to 80 babies in her first year of life! Not only is that a lot of rabbits,
                      back-to-back pregnancies can take a terrible toll on mum-rabbit.
                      It is very important to desex
                      your female rabbit even if she is not housed with a male as accidents can still happen.
                      For example - we have many cases where unspeyed female
                      rabbits become pregnant to wild male rabbits. Wild rabbits can
                      break into a female rabbit’s cage or if the female is feeling very
                      hormonal she may even break or dig her way out!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Desexing your rabbit also prevents health problems in the future -
                      female rabbits, for example, are extremely prone to uterine
                      cancer, which is fatal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Rabbits are very hormonal creatures and being entire (not desexed)
                      can cause them mental stress. They are likely to pace,
                      spray, dig and just be generally destructive. Desexing your
                      rabbit helps relax their temperament. It also helps prevent female
                      rabbits from having ‘false pregnancies’ which are very, very
                      common. A false pregnancy can drive a rabbit to pull out her fur,
                      make a nest and even produce milk which is all very stressful on
                      a her body. This can happen even if you have NO male rabbits
                      around.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Desexed rabbits are also a lot easier to bond. They are less
                      territorial and enjoy the company of other rabbits without the
                      hormonal stress.
                    </li>

                  <h3>Rabbit Health</h3>
                  <p>
                    Rabbits are quite fragile creatures and, as prey animals, they hide
                    pain and injury well. They do this so that predators will not see them as an easy target. Unfortunately,
                    this means that by the time your rabbit shows outward signs of illness it could be very
                    serious. If you see <i>any</i> sign of illness in your rabbit, take them to a rabbit-savvy vet right away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here are some common problems rabbits in New Zealand face:
                  </p>

                  <h5>Gut Stasis:</h5>
                  <p>
                    If your rabbit stops eating or appears to be off its food, it is imperative
                    you keep a very close eye on them. If a rabbit stops eating then their
                    gut may go into stasis and this can be fatal within just 24hrs. If you
                    put down their favourite food and they turn their nose up at it, take
                    them straight to a rabbit savvy vet.
                  </p>

                  <a name="Calici"></a>
                  <h5>RHD/Calici virus:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD, RCD, VHD, Calici & Calicivirus...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is known by many names, but it is the one thing that has
                    bunny owners shaking in their boots.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SO what exactly is this disease, and what can we do about
                    it? There is a lot of misinformation out there, and we plan
                    to make things very clear for all you bunny lovers out there!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first thing you need to know is: There are THREE strains
                    of RHD in New Zealand. RHDV1 was illegally released in 1997,
                    RHDV1-K5 was legally released in 2018, and RHDV2 was discovered
                    in May 2018 - this was NOT a planned release - likely it was
                    brought in illegally, or accidentally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How can we protect our rabbits?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RHDV1 & RHDV1-K5: VACCINATE. It's very important you vaccinate
                    your rabbits with CYLAP to protect your rabbit from the original
                    calicivirus, and the Korean strain. Your rabbits will need an
                    annual vaccination. Keep in mind no vaccination is 100% effective
                    and we suggest still taking precautions as listed below. Vaccinating
                    is still your rabbits BEST chance for survival.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RHDV2: This strain is much more of a concern for us. There
                    is currently NO vaccine in the country. There has only been
                    one rabbit (wild) confirmed to have contracted RHDV2 in New
                    Zealand so far, this was in Marlborough. Until we can get a
                    vaccine for this disease into the country - here are some ways
                    you can protect your rabbit from infection.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Control insects (especially flies and fleas) as much as possible both indoors and outdoors. Flies are the main carrier through which the virus is spread.</li>
                    <li>Remove uneaten food on a daily basis.</li>
                    <li>Rabbit-proof your backyard to prevent access by wild rabbits. Bring your rabbits indoors where possible.</li>
                    <li>Regularly decontaminate equipment and materials (e.g. cages, hutches, bowls) with either 10% bleach or 10% sodium hydroxide. Leave on the surfaces for 10mins and then rinse off.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands, clothing and shoes after handling other people’s rabbits.</li>
                    <li>Avoid cutting grass and feeding it to your rabbits if there is the risk of contamination from wild rabbits. This includes picking forage from the ground - I know a lot of us do this! You are much better off growing your own food from seed.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    If you think your rabbit may have calici (any of the three
                    strains) please call your vet immediately. Unfortunately it
                    is very rare for an unvaccinated rabbit to survive calici,
                    but your rabbit will require pain relief and fluids if you
                    have caught it early, or euthanasia if there is no chance of
                    survival. You must prevent your rabbit from suffering, it is
                    a horrendously painful disease - your vet (choose a rabbit
                    savvy vet where possible) will be able to advise you once you
                    speak to them and your rabbit has been examined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    IF your rabbit dies and you are unsure how, PLEASE contact
                    your nearest vet or MPI so a post mortem can be organised.
                    It's important we are able to track the spread of this disease.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I hope this post helps to clarify things for you all. There
                    is a lot of confusion between RHDV1-k5, and RHDV2 at the moment!
                  </p>

                  <h5>Coccidiosis:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Coccidiosis is caused by a type of parasite called a coccidian
                    protozoa. This parasite is widespread and can be found throughout
                    New Zealand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rabbits are most at risk during their first nine months of life.
                    Older rabbits appear to be more resistant to infections, but a
                    rabbit who is weak or immunocompromised by still be in danger.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most rabbits carry small numbers of coccidia in their digestive
                    system. This is normal, but in some cases these parasite can
                    overwhelm the immune system and build up to high numbers. This
                    can cause illness and, in severe cases, death.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Signs your rabbit may have coccidiosis:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Diarrhoea (or runny poos)</li>
                    <li>Weight loss</li>
                    <li>Lack of appetite</li>
                    <li>Lethargy</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    If your rabbit is showing any of the above signs please take them
                    to a rabbit savvy vet immediately.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Treatment:</h5>
                  <p>
                    There are many different products available to treat coccidia. We
                    have found baycox to be the most effective treatment in cases we
                    have seen. Your local vet can prescribe this for you.
                    Due to the life cycle of the parasite, Baycox should be given at a rate
                    of 2.5 to 5mg/kg for two consecutive days, then wait five days and
                    repeat the treatment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Almost all animal species have their own, species-specific form of
                    coccidia parasite. Rabbit coccidia only affects rabbits and is not
                    infectious for humans or other non-rabbit pets.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Dental Health:</h5>
                  <p>
                    A rabbit’s teeth grow continuously throughout its life and it
                    is vital that they eat high-fibre food to wear these down. A
                    rabbit with overgrown teeth will have difficulty eating and may
                    develop other problems as a result. Sometimes a rabbit’s teeth
                    can also develop spurs which cut into their mouth. This can be
                    very painful and deter them from eating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A very common dental problem for rabbits is malocclusion. This
                    means their teeth do not meet, and therefore do not wear down the
                    way they should. If your rabbit is exhibiting any of the following
                    signs please get your rabbit to a vet ASAP:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Weepy Eyes</li>
                    <li>Lack of appetite</li>
                    <li>Wet chin/Dribbling</li>
                    <li>Swelling around the face/mouth</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>Flystrike:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Rabbits with runny poos/diarrhoea or injuries (infected wounds in
                    particular) can be prone to flystrike, particularly in summer. Flystrike
                    occurs when the fly lays its eggs in the poo around the rabbit’s
                    bottom or near/in the any wounds your rabbit might have. The
                    eggs then hatch into maggots which burrow into and eat the skin of
                    the rabbit, causing severe pain and often death from shock. Flystrike
                    rarely if ever affects healthy rabbits. It is VERY important to keep
                    your rabbit clean if it has diarrhoea. You can do this by clipping the
                    rabbit’s fur around their bottom and keeping the area clean.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Please DO NOT bath your rabbit and check with your rabbit savvy
                    vet if you wish to use shampoo to clean your rabbit’s bottom.
                    We only use Whoop Itch and Ouch shampoo on rabbits here at WRR
                    and only when the situation is dire! Rabbits cannot regulate their
                    body temperature well and when bathing a rabbit the water penetrates
                    right through the fur; unlike rain, which runs off their fur and
                    doesn’t go through to the skin. It is important to check
                    your rabbit for flystrike in the summer months. If your rabbit has
                    any signs of flystrike take it straight to a rabbit savvy vet!

                  <h5>Heatstroke:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Rabbits do not cope well in the heat and need a helping hand in the
                    summer months. Always ensure your rabbit has shade and plenty
                    of water. A good idea is to wet towels and hang them as shade
                    cloths - the moisture in the towels helps to cool the air. A good trick
                    is to freeze water bottles and then place them in your rabbit’s hutch
                    or run for them to lie next to on hot days, you can wrap the bottle
                    in a tea towel.

                    A fun way to keep your rabbit cool and give them enrichment at the
                    same time is to freeze pieces of fresh fruit with water in ice cube
                    trays - popsicles for bunnies!. Don't forget to include this in your
                    bunny's fruit allowance for the day. If you rabbit is indoors, ensure
                    the curtains are pulled to give them shade and consider using a fan
                    to keep the air flowing and cool.

                  <h5>Pastuerella/Rabbit Snuffles:</h5>
                  <p>
                    All rabbits carry a bacteria in their respiratory tract called
                    Pastuerella. Some rabbits are more susceptible to the symptoms
                    of this bacteria and some only develop symptoms in times of stress
                    or ill health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pastuerella can cause your rabbit to have cold like symptoms.
                    Some rabbits get over this quite quickly on their own, but
                    sometimes it can develop quickly into a more serious or recurring
                    illness of the respiratory tract. If you notice your rabbit is sneezing,
                    look out for it producing any mucus from the nose or eyes. Rabbits
                    often use their front paws to wipe their faces so if you see mucus
                    on their front feet this is a tell-tale sign.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Take your bunny to see a rabbit savvy vet if your rabbit has mucus,
                    appears lethargic or, as with all other rabbit illnesses, if they stop
                    eating or using the toilet.

                  <h5>Fleas and Mites:</h5>
                  <p>
                    Rabbit’s aren’t as prone to getting fleas as a dog or cat, but mites
                    are very common, particularly during the Spring/Summer months.
                    You can treat your rabbit with Revolution Small Animal for both
                    fleas and mites. Please talk to your vet about the dose rate before
                    giving your rabbit Revolution as some smaller breeds of rabbit
                    may not need the full packet. Guinea pig mites can also be treated
                    with this product.
