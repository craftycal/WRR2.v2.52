            <h2>Care Guide</h2>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
              Rabbits need unlimited access
              to hay and/or grass. They are
              fibrevores; which means first and
              foremost, they need fiber.
              Therefore the most essential part
              of any rabbit’s diet is both grass
              and hay.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Water…</b> Rabbits need access to clean drinking water 24/7. Depending
              on your rabbit’s preference, this can be in a heavy bowl (they
              tend to tip over plastic bowls), a licker bottle, or both. You should
              clean out and change your rabbit’s water container regularly.
            </p>
            <img src="images/rabbit-models-46(1)-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
            <p>
              Hay… provides long-strand fiber, which is essential for a rabbit’s
              gut. It also helps to keep a rabbit’s teeth in order. Rabbit’s teeth
              grow continuously throughout their life and they need to eat fibrous
              foods in order to keep their teeth worn down. Rabbits that
              don’t eat enough hay develop painful spurs on their teeth, which if
              left untreated will make it painful for them to eat. They may even
              stop eating which in a rabbit is fatal.
            </p>
            <img src="images/rabbit-models-37-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
            <p>
              Rabbits will naturally graze all day long so they should always have
              access to fresh, good quality hay. You can purchase hay from local farm
              stores such as Rural Trading Post and Sharpes. You can also find a
              variety of hay at pet stores.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grass… the fibrous content of grass keeps a Rabbit’s gut mobile.
              The action of them nibbling on grass is also good for their teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vegetables… Rabbits love green vegetables and a good guide is
              about a cup of fresh vegetables per day. Leafy greens are best such
              as Kale, Broccoli including broccoli stalks and leaves, Silver-beet, Celery,
              Spinach and herbs such as Parsley and Coriander. Rabbits also
              love carrot tops, the carrot itself should be fed in moderation as it
              has a high sugar content so too much is not good for your rabbit.
              Please be aware any vegetables that are high in water content are not great for your rabbit, iceberg
              lettuce in particular should
              be avoided. If you do feed your
              rabbit lettuce ensure it’s a small
              amount and your rabbit has
              access to plenty of fibrous food
              such as hay.
            </p>
            <img src="images/rabbit-models-15(1)-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
            <p>
              Fruit… Rabbits naturally have a very sweet tooth and fruit is a great
              way to give them a treat. About 1-2 tablespoons of fruit a day is
              recommended. Rabbits love bananas, apples, grapes, mango and
              pears. Dried fruits are also great treats, for example raisins, dried
              pineapple, dried apricots and dates etc. Please remove the pips
              from all fruit where possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rabbit Pellets… The general rule with rabbit food is that the plainer
              it is – the better. Where possible avoid muesli style food and opt
              for a plain high fiber pellet.
              The best rabbit pellet brands available in NZ are Oxbow and Burgess
              Excel. If you are buying from a farm store then the best brand is
              NRM.
            </p>
            <p>
              Forage… Several common garden plants are safe for rabbits to eat
              and they are generally good at knowing what they can and can’t eat.
              However, please only feed plants that you know are not poisonous
              to your rabbit and ensure they have not been sprayed with weedkiller
              or pesticides. As with any new food, add it in gradually to your
              rabbits diet and keep an eye out for any changes in your rabbit’s
              poo, especially diarrhea. (If your rabbit has diarrhea contact a rabbit
              savvy vet immediately).
            </p>
            <p>
              Branches are great for rabbits to
              chew on and again this is good
              for their teeth. Try Willow or
              Taupata and fruit branches such
              as Apple. Flax is also good for
              them to chew on and will keep
              them occupied.
            </p>
            <img src="images/rabbit-models-9-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
            <p>
              Caecotrophs… As part of their normal diet rabbits eat a particular
              kind of their own droppings called Caecotrophs. They do this as
              they cannot extract all the vital fiber and nutrients they need first
              time around. Unlike the normal dry droppings you often see caecotrophs
              are shiny, sticky and smelly droppings. Rabbits eat these
              directly from the anus so you shouldn’t see them often. To see
              them occasionally is normal but regularly may mean your rabbit’s
              diet is either too rich or they are having problems eating them possibly
              due to obesity, large dewlaps, dental problems etc. You should
              contact a rabbit savvy vet if you have any concerns.

            <h3>Housing</h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to housing your rabbit the general rule is the more
              space the better. Rabbits need lots of exercise!
            </p>
            <p>
              WRR has a minimum space
              requirement of 1m wide x
              1m high x 2m long – this
              should include a warm dry
              ‘bed’ space of at least 61cm
              x 61cm
            </p>
            Most hutches available on
            the market are too small to
            be the only place for rabbits
            to live in.
          </p>

          <p>
            They can easily be adapted by permanently attaching runs or pens.
            Pens can be made more secure by adding a roof. If you have a
            secure property then you could use something as simple as bird
            netting or chicken mesh over the top. If you feel predators could be
            an issue you should use weldmesh.
            Areas of your home and garden can also be made rabbit proof so
            your rabbits can live free range. Feel free to message us for suggestions
            and advice!
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbits are very tidy creatures and can be litter trained. You can
            use a cat litter tray (I find this works best) or the corner litter trays
            designed for rabbits. You can use many different things for litter
            – the best type of litter is recycled newspaper litter. A good idea is
            to line the tray with newspaper, put down the recycled newspaper
            litter and then put straw over top.
          </p>
          <p>
            Litter training is SUPER easy!
            Every time they poop just
            scoop it up and place it in the
            litter tray until your bunny gets
            the idea. If you find they aren’t
            choosing to pee in their litter
            tray then if you place a tissue in
            their pee and then place it under
            the straw in the litter tray
            this will help them know where
            to go.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are planning on having indoor – litter trained rabbits then
            you need to “rabbit proof” your house. Rabbits love to chew cords
            – whether they are plugged in or not… to save your bunny getting
            shocked and your wallet in replacing cords we recommend having
            any cords tied up and well out of bunny reach!

          <h3>Enrichment</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits are highly intelligent and are often misunderstood due to
            their quiet nature. They need lots of stimulation to prevent them
            from getting bored. These don’t need to be expensive toys.
          </p>
          <p>
            A great bunny toy is a simple cardboard box, just cut two door holes
            in it and they will happily explore it and enjoy “renovating” (chewing
            their own holes)! A cardboard tube/empty toilet roll or egg box
            stuffed with hay and a few raisins makes a great toy, as do fabric
            tunnels. They also love digging and jumping so fill a box with soil or
            try giving them a sandpit.

          <h3>Socialisation/Rabbit Bonding</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits are very social animals
            and thrive with company of
            their own kind. In the wild they
            live in large colonies and this
            social side of their nature is still
            very evident in the domestic
            rabbit. At WRR we don’t believe
            any rabbit should live alone.
            This is partly for its mental
            health; they need interaction
            and a friend for company, but
            also for their physical wellbeing. Rabbits are very clean animals
            and will ‘groom’ each other. This is also a sign of affection between
            rabbits.
          </p>
          <img src="images/001-(4)-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
          <p>
            Rabbits are however also very territorial. You can’t simply put two
            rabbits together and expect them to get along. As a general rule the
            best pairing for rabbits is a desexed male and a desexed female,
            but this is not always the case. Some same sex pairs can get along
            great, as can groups of three, four or more rabbits - given the right
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Young rabbits housed together will often begin to fight when they
            reach sexual maturity and if the fighting leads to biting or any skin
            injury they need to be separated until they are desexed.
          </p>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/600x400" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
          <p>
            WRR help to ‘bond’ rabbits. Bonding
            involves introducing rabbits
            on neutral territory; where neither
            rabbit has been before, for short
            periods of time depending on how
            they get along. For more information
            on bonding two rabbits
            please contact us.

          <h3>The Rabbit Human Relationship</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits are prey animals and contrary to popular belief, most do
            not like being picked up. This is because to a rabbit, being picked up
            off the ground is similar to being caught by a predator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbits do however like receiving
            attention with all four legs
            on the ground. They love having
            their heads and ears stroked
            and many like their cheeks
            rubbed.
          </p>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/600x400" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
          <p>
            You do however often need to earn a rabbit’s trust. A good way
            to let your rabbit know you aren’t a threat or a predator is just to
            spend time with it. Get down to their level and sit or lie down in
            their pen, allow them to come to you in their own time. This may
            take some time but it’s worth being patient. Rabbits love treats like
            dried fruit so try hand feeding them one or two morsels when you
            sit with them. They will soon start to associate you with treats and
            before too long will run up to you and allow you to pat them.
          </p>

        <section><a name="Desexing"></a>
          <h3>Desexing</h3>
          <p>
            ALL rabbits should be desexed and vaccinated. Here are a few good
            reasons why:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There are too many unwanted rabbits in animal shelters all
              over the New Zealand Unfortunately a huge number of healthy
              rabbits are euthanised each day because there are not enough
              homes or spaces in shelters for them. Desexing your rabbit
              means preventing more animals suffering this fate. (WRR never
              euthanises rabbits unless they are too sick or injured to survive
              and it is in their best interest. This decision is never taken lightly.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Rabbits breed like rabbits and they are very virile; a female
              rabbit can have up to 10 babies per litter and can get pregnant
              again as soon as she has given birth. It is very important to desex
              your female rabbit even if she is not housed with a male rabbit.
              For example - we have many cases where unspeyed female
              rabbits become pregnant to wild male rabbits. Wild rabbits can
              break into a female rabbit’s cage or if the female is feeling very
              hormonal she may even break or dig her way out!
            </li>
            <li>
              Desexing your rabbit also prevents health problems in the future…
              female rabbits for example are extremely prone to uterine
              cancer, which is fatal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rabbits are very hormonal creatures and being entire (not desexed)
              can cause them mental stress. They are likely to pace,
              spray, dig and just be destructive in general. Desexing your
              rabbit helps relax their temperament. It also helps prevent female
              rabbits from having ‘false pregnancies’ which are very, very
              common. A false pregnancy can drive a rabbit to pull out her fur,
              make a nest and even produce milk which is all very stressful on
              a her body. This can happen even if you have NO male rabbits
              around.
            </li>
            <li>
              Desexed rabbits are also a lot easier to bond. They are less
              territorial and enjoy the company of other rabbits without the
              hormonal stress.
            </li>

          <h3>Rabbit Health</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits are quite fragile creatures and as prey animals they hide
            pain and injury well. They do this so as not to draw attention to
            themselves (from potential predators). This means that often by
            the time your rabbit shows outward signs of illness it could be very
            serious!
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some common problems rabbits in New Zealand face:
          </p>
          <p>
            Gut Stasis:
            If your rabbit stops eating or appears to be off its food it is imperative
            you keep a very close eye on them. If a rabbit stops eating his
            gut may go into stasis and this can be fatal within just 24hrs. If you
            put down their favourite food and they turn their nose up at it take
            them straight to a rabbit savvy vet.
          </p>
          <p>
            RHD/Calici Virus:
            Rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD), also known as haemorrhagic viral
            disease (RHVD), is a disease that kills rabbits. It was illegally introduced
            into New Zealand in 1997. Thirty to eighty percent of animals
            exposed to the virus will develop the disease. Almost 100% of
            infected animals will die.<br>
            It is unsure how the virus is transmitted, but at this stage it is assumed
            that rabbits acquire this highly infectious virus by breathing
            it in, ingestion, direct contact or through infected urine or faeces. Insects
            are also able to carry the virus, so isolation from other rabbits
            is not enough to prevent this nasty disease affecting your rabbit.
            The incubation period is 1-3 days and research has shown that rabbits
            younger than 8 weeks of age are usually resistant to the virus.
            There are three forms of the disease which, in severe cases, causes
            bleeding in the lungs, the windpipe, liver, spleen, kidneys and the
            heart.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Death without any other signs.
            </li>

            <li>
              Depression, anorexia, difficulty breathing, shaking, and death
              within one to two days. Other signs may include a foamy or bloody
              discharge from the nose or anus, nervous signs or rapid death. Rabbits
              may appear to recover, then die several days later
            </li>
            <li>
              Mild form – depression, anorexia followed by recovery. These animals
              become immune from re-infection
              Rabbits can be vaccinated from 6 weeks old, at which age they will
              require boosters every 3 to 4 weeks until they are 3 months old. If
              vaccination commences at 2.5-3 months old, they will not require
              another booster that year. In order to maintain immunity, it is recommended
              that all vaccinated rabbits receive an annual booster.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Coccidiosis:<br>
            Coccidiosis is a widespread parasitic infection that can cause disease
            in rabbits. Coccidiosis is caused by a type of parasite called a
            coccidian protozoa.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbits are more susceptible to the disease for the first 8-9 months
            of their lives. Older rabbits appear to be more resistant to infections,
            but a rabbit immune compromised, or weakened in some
            way may also be susceptible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost all rabbits carry small numbers of coccidia as a normal part
            of their gastrointestinal flora. In some cases these parasite can
            overwhelm the immune system and build up to high numbers. This
            can cause illness and in severe cases, death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Signs your rabbit may have coccidiosis:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Diarrhoea (or runny poos)</li>
            <li>Weight loss</li>
            <li>Lack of appetite</li>
            <li>Lethargy</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your rabbit is showing any of the above signs please take him/her
            to your local rabbit savvy vet immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treatment:<br>
            There are many different products available to treat coccidia. We
            have found baycox to be the most effective treatment in cases we
            have seen. Your local vet can prescribe this for you.
            Due to the life cycle of the parasite Baycox should be given at a rate
            of 2.5 to 5mg/kg for two consecutive days, then wait five days and
            repeat the treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost all animal species have their own species specific form of
            coccidia parasite. Rabbit coccidia only affects rabbits, and is not
            infectious for humans or other non-rabbit pets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dental Health:<br>
            A rabbit’s teeth grow continuously
            throughout its life
            and it is vital they eat high
            fibre food to wear these
            down. Sometimes a rabbit’s
            teeth can grow and develop
            spurs which cut into their
            mouth, this can be very
            painful and deter them from
            eating.
          </p>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/600x400" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
          <p>
            A very common dental problem for rabbits is malocclusion. This
            means their teeth do not meet, therefore do not wear down the
            way they should. If your rabbit is exhibiting any of the following
            signs please get your rabbit to a vet ASAP:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weepy Eyes</li>
            <li>Lack of appetite</li>
            <li>Wet chin/Dribbling</li>
            <li>Swelling around the face/mouth</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Flystrike:<br>
            Rabbits with runny poos/diarrhoea or injuries (infected wounds in
            particular) can be prone to flystrike, particularly in summer. Flystrike
            occurs when the fly lays its eggs in the poo around the rabbit’s
            bottom or near/in the any wounds your rabbit might have. The
            eggs then hatch into maggots which burrow into and eat the skin of
            the rabbit causing severe pain and often death from shock. Flystrike
            rarely if ever affects healthy rabbits. It is VERY important to keep
            your rabbit clean if it has diarrhoea. You can do this by clipping the
            rabbit’s fur around its bottom and keeping the area clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please DO NOT bath your rabbit and check with your rabbit savvy
            vet if you wish to use shampoo to clean your rabbit’s bottom.
            We only use Whoop Itch and Ouch shampoo on rabbits here at WRR
            and only when the situation is dire! Rabbits cannot regulate their
            body temperature well and when bathing a rabbit the water penetrates
            right through the fur; unlike rain, which runs off their fur and
            doesn’t penetrate right through to the skin. It is important to check
            your rabbit for flystrike in the summer months. If your rabbit has
            any signs of flystrike take it straight to a rabbit savvy vet!
          </p>
          <p>
            Heatstroke:<br>
            Rabbits do not cope well in the heat and need a helping hand in the
            summer months. Always ensure your rabbit has shade and plenty
            of water. A good idea is to wet towels and hang them as shade
            cloths - the moisture in the towels helps to cool the air. A good trick
            is to freeze water bottles and then place them in your rabbit’s hutch
            or run for them to lie next to on hot days, you can wrap the bottle
            in a tea towel.
          </p>
          <p>
            A fun way to keep your rabbit cool and give him enrichment at the
            same time is to freeze pieces of fresh fruit with water in ice cube
            trays which are like popsicles when popped out and given to your
            bunny a few at a time.
            If you rabbit is indoors ensure the curtains are pulled to give them
            shade and you can use a fan to keep the air flowing and cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pastuerella/Rabbit Snuffles:<br>
            All rabbits carry a bacteria in their respiratory tract called Pastuerella.
            Some rabbits are more susceptible to the symptoms of this
            bacteria and some only develop symptoms in times of stress or ill
            health.
          </p>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/600x400" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
          <p>
            The pastuerella bacteria can cause
            your rabbit to have cold like symptoms.
            Some rabbits get over this
            quite quickly on their own, but
            sometimes it can develop quickly
            into a more serious or recurring
            illness of the respiratory tract. If
            you notice your rabbit is sneezing,
            look out for it producing any mucus
            from the nose or eyes. Rabbits
            often use their front paws to wipe
            their faces so if you see mucus on
            their front feet this is a tell-tale
            sign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take your bunny to see a rabbit savvy vet if your rabbit has mucus,
            appears lethargic or as with all other rabbit illnesses – if he stops
            eating/pooing/peeing!
          </p>
          <p>
            Fleas/Mites:<br>
            Rabbit’s aren’t as prone to getting fleas as a dog or cat, but mites
            are very common particularly during the Spring/Summer months.
            You can treat your rabbit with Revolution Small Animal for both
            Fleas and Mites. Please talk to your vet about the dose rate before
            giving your rabbit Revolution as some smaller breeds of rabbit and
            Guinea Pig may not need an entire pipette.
