            Here are some things you need to know before adopting from Wellington
            Rabbit Rescue! At Wellington Rabbit Rescue we make a commitment for
            life. This means that every bunny that comes through and gets adopted,
            <b>MUST</b> be returned to us if you can no longer care for him. This is VERY
            important.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of our rabbits are neutered/spayed and vaccinated <b>BEFORE</b> going to
            their forever homes. We prefer to adopt to people who also have spayed/neutered
            rabbits and we urge you to get this done before finding a companion for
            your rabbit. We can give you a list of rabbit savvy vets in your area.
          </p>
          <p>
            To adopt through Wellington Rabbit Rescue you will need to have an inspection
            of your yard/enclosure/room to ensure it is big enough and secure enough
            from predators. (This may be done via photos in most cases). We prefer
            free-range homes, but we will also accept large fenced off areas of your
            house or property. This must be at the very minimum 2 metres by 2 metres
            with at least 1.5 metres height - <b>AT ALL TIMES</b>. There must be a warm dry
            shelter of at least 60cmx60cm. You also must have some kind of enrichment
            equipment / things for your rabbits to jump on and off. If you want to
            find out ways to build a nice safe (and large) area for your bunny - please
            get in touch we are more than happy to help. There are some very cost-effective
            ways to do this.

            We only rehome rabbits in pairs, unless of course they are going to be a
            companion to your existing rabbit! We feel itâ€™s not fair to keep a rabbit
            all on his own as they are very social creatures and thrive with their own
            kind for company. We cannot speak the same language as them (as hard as we
            try) so it's important they have a bond partner. If you are adopting a rabbit
            as a companion for your existing rabbit then you will need to bring them out
            to have a meet & greet with any WRR rabbit you would like to adopt, in some
            cases we may be able to bring a potential friend to you if your bunny does
            not travel well. This meeting is to ensure they will get along, we will
            then give you advice on bonding, and be with you every step of the way.
          </p>

            Rabbits can live until they are 10-12 years. You need to be ready to care
            for your rabbit for this long. This includes annual health checks and
            vaccinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our adoption fee is $85 for one rabbit or $150 for a pair. This money
            goes towards the cost of desexing, vaccinations & other veterinary costs
            while in our care.
