        Wellington Rabbit Rescue is a registered not for profit charity that takes
        on abused, neglected, sick, injured, abandoned, and unwanted rabbits.
      </p>
      <p>
        While they are in our care they receive any veterinary treatment they may
        require. They are housed in large enclosures so they can exhibit natural
        rabbit behaviour and they are fed a high quality diet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the rabbits are healthy and ready for adoption they are desexed and
        vaccinated. If any of the rabbits in our care are too young to be desexed
        they are sent home with a desex agreement which we follow up once the rabbit
        is old enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        We inspect any potential homes. We require the rabbits to be housed in a
        large area. They need to be able to run and jump. We also encourage new
        owners to include enrichment toys. Our minimum standard is an area 2 metres
        long, 1 metre wide, 1 metre high as well as a warm dry house at least 61x61cm.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not send rabbits home on their own as they are social creatures.
        If the potential new family has an existing rabbit then we help mix/bond
        before the adoption can be processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any rabbits that cannot be rehomed will remain in our care. We only resort
        to euthanasia in extreme cases such as very ill or severely injured rabbits.
        In this case we will have them humanely euthanized by our vet to prevent
        further suffering.
